Java Stream is a way to process a collection of data one by one, in a clean and readable manner.

👉 It does not store data
👉 It processes data

Real-life example 🧺
Imagine you have a basket of apples 🍎🍎🍎
You want to:
Pick only red apples
Remove damaged ones
Count how many are left

You don’t create a new basket manually for every step.
You pass the basket through steps.

That’s exactly what Stream does to data.

Important point: A Stream is created from a collection, but it is NOT a collection itself.
